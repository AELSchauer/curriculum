# Extension: Extend character map to include uppercase letters

The character map consisting of all the lowercase letters, then numbers, space, period and comma worked well when our organization was still small. As the battle has progressed and our organization has grown, we now also need uppercase letters to better communicate internally.

The messages still ends with: `..end..`

## Expected behavior

Extend the character map to include uppercase letters as well. The character map should include all uppercase letters, all lowercase letters, followed by digits 0-9, followed by space, then period and then comma.
