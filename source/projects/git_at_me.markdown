## Git at Me

We all love [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for managing source control in our
projects. But sometimes the Git command line interface can be a bit daunting.
Additionally, it would be neat if we could go a little bit deeper with stats or analysis
of our projects than Git's CLI really allows.

Fortunately, git makes its data pretty accessible. If we have a good data
source for the commits in a repository, we could build our own
interface that exposes some of these functions.

In this project, we'll be building our own CLI to perform additional
analysis on git projects.

### Data Source

[This file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5mpmaa56fusowvd/curriculum_git_repo.json?dl=0)
contains a JSON dump of the commits from the Turing [Curriculum](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum)
repository. We'll use it to build our own Command Line Interface that lets us
answer questions about this data.

### Generating Additional Git JSON dumps

If you'd like to try it out with a different git repository, you can use this
[python script](https://github.com/paulrademacher/gitjson) to generate
JSON dumps for other git repositories.
