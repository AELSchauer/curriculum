# Iteration 4: Merchant Analytics

Our operations team is asking for better data about of our merchants and have asked for the following:

Find out the total revenue for a given date:

```rb
sa = SalesAnalyst.new

sa.merchant_revenue_by_date(date) #=> $$
```

Find the top x performing merchants in terms of revenue:  

```rb
sa = SalesAnalyst.new

sa.top_revenue_earners(x) #=> [merchant, merchant, merchant, merchant, merchant]
```

If no number is given for `top_revenue_earners`, it takes the top 20 merchants by default:

```rb
sa = SalesAnalyst.new

sa.top_revenue_earners #=> [merchant * 20]
```

Which merchants have pending invoices:

```rb
sa = SalesAnalyst.new

sa.merchants_with_pending_invoices #=> [merchant, merchant, merchant]
```

**Note:** an invoice is considered pending if one or more of itâ€™s transactions are not successful.

Which merchants had only one transaction:

```rb
sa = SalesAnalyst.new

sa.merchants_with_only_one_invoice #=> [merchant, merchant, merchant]
```

Find the total revenue for a single merchant:

```rb
sa = SalesAnalyst.new

sa.revenue_by_merchant(merchant_id) #=> $
```

which item sold most in terms of quantity and revenue:

```rb
sa = SalesAnalyst.new

sa.most_sold_item_for_merchant(merchant_id) #=> [item, item] (in terms of quantity sold)

sa.best_item_for_merchant(merchant_id) #=> item (in terms of revenue generated)
```
