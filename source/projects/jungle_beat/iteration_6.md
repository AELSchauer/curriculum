# Iteration 6 - Playing Beats

Now that we have our JungleBeat class put together using the internal Linked List to keep track of our beats, let's use it to actually play the beats.

Remember that, at the command line, we can play sounds using the `say` command:

```
$ say -r 500 -v Boing "ding dah oom oom ding oom oom oom ding dah oom oom ding dah oom oom ding dah oom oom "
```
