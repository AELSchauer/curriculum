In this assessment you will:

* Build a web-based scrabble word tracker
* Use test-driven development
* Demonstrate mastery of all parts of the Rails stack
* Demonstrate mastery of Ruby throughout the process

## Expectations

* Work on the exercise with your facilitator
* The facilitator will assign you a challenge similar but not identical to those
in the test suite. The facilitator may change the expectations or ask additional
questions to assess your understandings/skills
* As you work, you *should*:
  * Think out loud so your facilitator can understand your process
  * Ask questions of your facilitator
  * Reference external public resources (ie: Google, Ruby API, etc)
  * Use the tooling most comfortable to you (Editor/IDE, testing framework, support tools like Guard, etc)
* As you work, you *should not*:
  * Copy code snippets other than those present in this description
  * Seek live support from individuals other than your facilitator
* After you complete the exercise, please use discretion with your classmates to allow them an authentic evaluation experience

## Preparation

Before the session starts:

* Have the [display driver installed](http://www.displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.php)
* Clone the repo from GitHub: [scrabble-web](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/scrabble-web)
* Run `bundle` to install dependencies
* Run the test suite (`bundle exec rake test`) and see that it has several pending tests
* Setup any external tooling you want (your editor, etc)

## Feature Description

For this exercise, the feature will be assigned by the facilitator. You can find
example features implemented as tests in the project repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way
* 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them
* 2: Developer can execute an algorithm or plan given to them
* 1: Developer struggles to implement an algorithm or plan

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 4: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions using the best-choice tools Ruby has to offer
* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby
* 2: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts
* 1: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help
with fundamental concepts

### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support
* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance
* 2: Developer is generally able to utilize Rails, but shows confusion or shallow knowledge about what Rails provides
* 1: Developer needs *significant* support to utilize Rails' elementary methods/concepts

### 4. Rails Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack
* 2: Developer struggles with some essential concepts of MVC
* 1: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

### 5. Testing

* 4: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development
* 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development
* 2: Developer struggles to use tests to drive development
* 1: Developer develops without guidance from tests

### 6. Collaboration

* 4: Developer *actively seeks* collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
* 2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops
* 1: Developer is able to integrate unsolicited feedback but does not really collaborate
