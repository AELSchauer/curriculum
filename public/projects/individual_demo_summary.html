<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>it works is real time and is actually fun.</p>

<p>love this project</p>

<p>Real time sync, run by a master controller.</p>

<p>Treevia.</p>

<p>slick. fun. does what it says it does. could be used in real life.</p>

<p>Easy of use.</p>

<p>OMG THAT WAS FUN</p>

<p>That it does exactly what it is supposed to and does it well. It&#8217;s fun, and grabs people immediately.</p>

<ul>
<li>Awesome idea</li>
<li>Fun game</li>
</ul>

<p>Some minor stability issues but overall the app is fantastic. Slick design, works great, could definitely sell it and make cash money.</p>

<p>This app is so damn cool!  Amazing job, such a fun demo!</p>

<p>CRUSHES EVERYTHING. UI is great, responsive, seriously love this.</p>

<p>Great interface, simple, fun.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Trvia. Who doesn&#8217;t love trivia? It also doesn&#8217;t try to do too much. It recognizes the need to give some leeway in judging answers, etc, so doesn&#8217;t auto-mark correct answers, etc.</p>

<p>Very fun and I could see a lot of bars using this.</p>

<p>This is the way bar trivia ought to be done.</p>

<p>product that I would use for sure</p>

<p>Useful, immediately applicable.</p>

<p>Simple, fun, could easily be implemented in real life</p>

<p>It&#8217;s awesome</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t quick enough to make a remote team for myself to participate, but the speed with which everyone else was able to make teams and join in and make it all work was great. Really nice job. </p>

<p>Pretty awesome, in terms of both usability and tech.</p>

<ul>
<li>Updating answers in real time</li>
<li>Seeing the other teams&#8217; answers after they&#8217;re all submitted</li>
<li>Fun and interactive! :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Fun interaction</p>

<p>The way it looked and functioned. Beautifully-executed.</p>

<p>It was fun to use as a group</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>This is my favorite of the &#8216;fun&#8217; (non-business analytics) apps.</p>

<p>TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TRIVA FTW.</p>

<p>Great job!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s fun because Trivia night is fun, but I think having it on a computer/iphone/ipad in real life would just encourage cheating.</p>

<p>Ship it.</p>

<p>If you deploy this at 918F, and couple it with a beer tasting or whatever else, I will book myself a ticket.</p>

<p>Again, not sure about security, but it just seems really clear and cool</p>

<ul>
<li>Landing page could be a little more informative, provide some actionable information (maybe a timer indicating how long until the game starts?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure that team joining is solved (we both signed up for the same team name).</p>

<p>You should launch this.</p>

<p>Straight forward UI, real-time data was impressive.</p>

<h3>Chris Anderson - Find Your Adventure</h3>

<p>UI: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 5</p>

<p>VALUE_PROPOSITION: 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 5, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>Really enjoy being able to see where all of the adventures are without having to go to a map. Filtering is great too.</p>

<p>Simple, beautiful, works great.</p>

<p>This needs to go live on LivingSocial.com</p>

<ul>
<li>First time experience message tells you exactly how to get started</li>
<li>The app is very fast</li>
<li>Filters work great</li>
<li>Concept is very simple but it&#8217;s feature-packed and super useful!</li>
</ul>

<p>The usability</p>

<p>Overall styling &amp; filtering.</p>

<p>UI is really slick and the filtering functionality is very intuitive and well-designed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s extremely intuitive.  I&#8217;d like to see this get folded into LS proper.</p>

<p>Does exactly what it&#8217;s supposed to. The bounce on the map markers is cool.</p>

<p>Very impressive. Nice design! Everything was really easy to use.</p>

<p>The full screen map interface is really awesome.  It looks really professional and polished.  Great job!</p>

<p>Nice integration with a real LivingSocial product; I could see this turning into a real app!</p>

<p>Simple, clean, seamless, very graceful interface</p>

<p>does what it says, looks great.  does what it says it will do, but might be overkill for the problem it solves.</p>

<p>I love how simple it is. It&#8217;s not doing anything complicated, however it presents the information in such a way that it improves on the original adventures site.</p>

<p>Great UI</p>

<ul>
<li>Beautiful interface</li>
<li>Very quick</li>
<li>Awesome idea</li>
</ul>

<p>UI is very slick and it&#8217;s a much more natural way to look at adventures</p>

<p>Really impressive interface integration, esp the very-responsive google maps integration. </p>

<p>I love when apps do a great job at distilling information.</p>

<p>Very slick UI &#8211; makes good use of AJAX to provide the user with feedback as they interact with the filters. It was a nice touch to dim the markers for unavailable deals.</p>

<p>I really like the realtime of sorting and filtering of the Adventures. Very nice for shopping and seeing what&#8217;s going on over a large area. </p>

<p>Power browsing for Adventures.  This piece is very well executed from a pure functional standpoint.</p>

<p>The maps! This would be a killer addition to Adventures on the production site. Not that far-flung adventures are hard to find, but the map-conceit reduces the mental overhead dramatically. </p>

<p>Solves a major issue with adventures</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>There is so little to change&#8230;when you click a city it&#8217;d be nice to center it a bit lower so you don&#8217;t have to scroll up to see the adventure title. But that&#8217;s a tiny thing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not immediately clear what the different colored icons mean; could use a legend of some sort (e.g., the filters on the left use only text but don&#8217;t associate immediately with the icon colors on the map)</li>
</ul>

<p>this needs to ship.</p>

<p>the sliders should probably not fire your events until mouse button-release.</p>

<p>I think the value proposition/usability would be enhanced even more if there was a bigger data set to work from.</p>

<p>Scroll doesn&#8217;t leave enough room for the pop up. Clicking the map doesn&#8217;t dismiss popup. Grey icon isn&#8217;t clear (expired? outside range?)</p>

<p>Wish we could expand this out to more than adventures/scale this up to escapes.</p>

<p>You are chief designer manderson!</p>

<p>This is SO much better than the shitty grid on the main page.  I think it would work much better if there were a lot of adventures; as it is, you can quickly filter out everything, but conceptually, it&#8217;s very cool and might actually make it feasible to have a lot of adventures running in a particular market.  Nice work.</p>

<p>Nice job!</p>

<p>Interesting concept, and you kept the interface very barebones. As mentioned above - the page would function extremely well for someone who wants to find an adventure.  I could see this as a great tool for market programmers to schedule adventures.  </p>

<p>If this is intended for consumers though, have a bit of a hole as there is no context provided for the user whatsoever.  if you had a set of landing pages that might explain what LivingSocial Adventures is / are, and explaining what / how this interface is for. If I should come across this without an understanding of LivingSocial and Adventures - I&#8217;d move on because I would have no idea what was going on.  Need to give users a reason to want to engage and find the content their looking for.</p>

<p>Maia Jose loves it.  She probably will want to speak with you about making it live.  </p>

<h3>Austen Ito - Living Socialism</h3>

<p>UI: 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 5, 5</p>

<p>VALUE_PROPOSITION: 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>Awesome that it actually buys something.</p>

<p>Savings</p>

<p>Great idea, great execution</p>

<p>AWESOME</p>

<p>I like the simplicity</p>

<p>The fact that you take away the work from the user and make it really easy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m slightly confused about the flow in terms of sharing with friends and such, but the overall functionality is amazing. Would love to see it live on the main site in some fashion.</p>

<p>this is cool.  dig it.  would use this and i know you so i trust you with my card info.</p>

<p>Very slick overall, not sure if I&#8217;d ever use it though just for fear of another third party having my CC info</p>

<p>Vive le socialisme! Great idea. Lots of possibilities for adding social interaction around the groupings etc.</p>

<p>That you are gaming me + 3 for your own profit :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean interface</li>
<li>Sweet idea - tough to scale though</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s a really interesting transformation of the &quot;me +3&quot; feature</p>

<ul>
<li>Love that you can see realtime updates on who is interested in the deal (a common complaint with the me + 3 thing is not knowing how many friends have bought so far)</li>
<li>Also like that you don&#8217;t have to buy the deal first and then hope that your friends will also buy&#8230;garner interest up front, then invest</li>
</ul>

<p>It sparks my imagination. Makes me wonder what kind of new things we could learn about our users if we offered a service that was something like this. It&#8217;s a deeper level of commitment to a deal than just having clicked through from the e-mail &#8211; these are people that want to buy the product, but would like &quot;just a little more&quot; savings.</p>

<p>I can save more money!</p>

<p>This is actually what I&#8217;d like me + 3 to be about anyway.  I&#8217;m much happier thinking that I got all of my friends a great deal on a great deal than if I feel like I&#8217;m taking advantage of them to pay my way.</p>

<p>The technical details are pretty impressive.</p>

<p>This app was my favorite of all.  So cool.  bravo!</p>

<p>The splash page is awesome!</p>

<p>Solves a common issue with our product</p>

<p>I really like the idea of effectively inviting people already in your circle to join a deal so you can all have a shared outing without any extra baggage with new accounts or weird hoops to jump through. </p>

<p>Connecting users to allow the purchase to be completely social is a completely necessary part of the process that Living Social is needing. This addresses it perfectly.</p>

<p>Can also be applied to many of the other verticals as well. </p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>would love to somehow be able to use deal bucks or for the voucher to show up in my livingsocial account</p>

<p>Great job!!</p>

<p>The UI is a bit clunky, but I like the concept, though this might have a negative impact on revenue :)</p>

<p>Possibly the best test coverage I&#8217;ve seen so far today, but still lacking.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nice UI, dawg</li>
</ul>

<p>We should ship this and see if it results in more Deal purchases. If it does, we should keep it running; if not, we should retire it. Sub-optimal me+3 may be more profitable for us. :D</p>

<p>I realize this is probably <em>way</em> against LivingSocial TOS.  Nonetheless, if we could find a way to legitimize this process, that&#8217;d be super awesome.</p>

<p>Potential legal issues and fraud detection might result in cancelation of vouchers.  How do you handle cancellations? </p>

<p>(typekit!)</p>

<p>Perfect idea.</p>

<h3>Mike Chlipala - Party Time</h3>

<p>UI: 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4</p>

<p>VALUE_PROPOSITION: 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 5, 5</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>The fact that it&#8217;s kind of social, that you can share playlists and tweet them.</p>

<p>I like the whole theme of democratizing a party playlist.  Heaven knows I&#8217;m not to be trusted with the soundtrack to anything.</p>

<p>This is awesome.  I will use this at home.  Great job Mike!</p>

<p>Technology backing is pretty great.</p>

<ul>
<li>So fast!</li>
<li>Love that it creates the playlist for you. Ideal for the indecisive and/or the lazy, like me.</li>
<li>Colors!</li>
<li>Great that you can add more tracks to the playlist</li>
<li>Super duper love the concept</li>
</ul>

<p>fun app.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Im going to use It!</li>
<li>Clean</li>
</ul>

<p>Barbie Girl</p>

<p>Easy of use.  It&#8217;s very easy to get a playlist.</p>

<p>Anyone with the link can add tracks; did a good job of adding relevant songs to the playlist</p>

<p>Excellent execution of technologies involved in the background, really well done.</p>

<p>Very useful and great design.</p>

<p>Love how smooth the music works, flash integration, etc.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to use. I&#8217;m a big fan of rdio and echonest works well.</p>

<p>Looks good</p>

<p>I like the idea of LS deals advertised on the side of a app.</p>

<p>Carly Rae Jepsen on demand - AWESOME. The design was great.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no penalty for not having an Rdio account; you don&#8217;t get full tracks, but that&#8217;s just how Rdio rolls and you can still participate (add tracks) anyway. It&#8217;s inclusive and social in a way that doesn&#8217;t require constant participation. </p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>Great job!!</p>

<p>It feels more like this ought to have been integrated with Pandora than with Rdio; I realize that wasn&#8217;t the technology card but if Mike were to continue developing it that might make an interesting pivot.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Nice-to-have&quot; feature: ability to rearrange the song order</li>
<li>Another nice-to-have: ability to have an account and see a list of multiple playlists that have been created for you </li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit simple, which is good and bad.  Would&#8217;ve liked to see a &quot;thumbs down&quot; for tracks so it could better learn  what to put in the playlist.</p>

<p>Include the websockets and this is more or less done</p>

<p>With the social component &amp; some websockets this would be fucking awesome.</p>

<p>It be nice to see a history of my previous playlists. Also I&#8217;d like to see what other people are listening to and see a playlist from other people&#8217;s custom playlists.</p>

<p>Not sure how this is much better than using Rdio or Spotify directly.</p>

<p>Web sockets or live loading new tracks would be cool.</p>

<h3>Andy Glass - Hunter</h3>

<p>UI: 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4</p>

<p>VALUE_PROPOSITION: 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>Love the filterability</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a salesperson, so I don&#8217;t know for sure - but I <em>think</em> this has the potential to make a lot of peoples&#8217; jobs a lot easier.</p>

<p>very impressed with this.  seems like it&#8217;s a quick way to access data for a lot of people who are doing it manually.</p>

<p>Fantastic idea, clearly a tool that our sales reps need and would want to use. The filtering controls are nice, but more input mechanisms are needed to finer-tune the filters. </p>

<p>The amount of information available to the company in one place because of your app is great. </p>

<p>Fantastic way of displaying data</p>

<p>Love this as a &quot;proof of concept&quot; and would love to see it developed as an serious internal tool.</p>

<p>The completeness and the overall understanding of the problem demonstrated.</p>

<p>Data seems fantastic</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Very practical &amp; useful</p></li>
<li><p>Filters are great</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of great data &#8211; categories, deal run dates, revenue, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Linking to Salesforce so user can immediately act on opportunity</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s clear a lot of thought went into the potential usage of this app</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Being able to view deal history for individual merchants from a popup.</p>

<p>Seems very useful to sales people.</p>

<p>Real-World Value. Rare in these projects.</p>

<p>usefulness/real world application at LS</p>

<p>The <em>amount</em> of information is no joke; Andy did a good job making it easy to consume as much or as little as you might want. Understandable even to someone who&#8217;s not in sales (i.e. me!).</p>

<p>Overall pretty seamless, stands as one with potentially the biggest immediate impact, I can see this being used internally tomorrow assuming the performance issues are stored out.</p>

<p>Shows a lot of thought around our existing gems and process. I enjoy the effort that went into shadowing the sales team.</p>

<p>This seems like it&#8217;d actually be a useful tool for sales / market analysis</p>

<p>I think this is one of the few projects that&#8217;s relevant to the company. Partially its the data that Andy has, however he executed extremely well. Awesome.</p>

<p>Very meaningful to sales team, business analytics types.</p>

<p>Cool UI and impressive JS work!</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>show Matt Lattman! He will want to implement it</p>

<p>The only complaint that I have is that when you first get to a market, the map is overcrowded with icons.  I know we have to start somewhere, and it&#8217;s better to have some data on the map than to have a blank slate - but maybe the default parameters could be set to some common search that salespersons would find useful, so as not to make the initial screen so intimidating?</p>

<p>nice work, Andy!</p>

<p>Great job!!!</p>

<p>Based on zoom level, you can aggregate/consolidate map icons.  This would clean up the map.  Perhaps an aggregate icon with a number next to it the displays how many restaurants there are.  </p>

<p>Needs more UI and performance work, but it is great!</p>

<p>Really really good job.  This is a very complete and well thought-out application, and a real understanding of the problem.  </p>

<p>This is my favorite of the &#8216;data/business&#8217; projects. Well done! :)</p>

<p>Test coverage is pretty low.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t login because I think too many people were hitting the site? Is it because the server is running on webrick?</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>I like that he allows a social aspect of planning a party.</p>

<ul>
<li>Awesome integration with google cal.</li>
<li>Clean beautiful interface</li>
<li>Real time capability is awesome. </li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s a ton of awesome functionality and the real time updating is fantastic, but the actual flow of creating events is slightly confusing. This app would be great if it didn&#8217;t rely on Take out and Delivery restaurants, but obviously that was a requirement.</p>

<p>The real time aspect and the google calendar integration.</p>

<p>Realtime updates, simplicity, style.</p>

<p>Real time updating</p>

<p>easy to use, integrates with google calendar.</p>

<p>Tons of really useful features.</p>

<p>Everything is real time.</p>

<p>The UI on this thing is so slick.  One small tweak would improve it a lot&#8211; seeing a list of close restaurants in the list without having the type the first letter.</p>

<p>I like the application of js to update in real time.</p>

<p>The live interaction is AWESOME.</p>

<ul>
<li>REALLY love that it automatically checks your calendar to see if you&#8217;re available</li>
<li>UI responses were very nice &#8211; updating icons after voting, etc.</li>
<li>Nice integration of social media</li>
</ul>

<p>Incredibly smooth integration with all of his external services, calendar and twitter are very, very streamlined to the point of seamlessness.</p>

<p>Message board &amp; calendar checking are my favorite features. There is a lot of functionality around that main screen - the schedule resolution could have probably even gotten more real estate given the amount of functionality it delivers.</p>

<p>I like the work flow from step to step. I always know what to do. It&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>

<p>Nice interface, well integrated with external services.</p>

<p>Lets me start planning before I sign in, but doesn&#8217;t lose any data on the transition</p>

<p>It&#8217;s quick and responsive. Live updating is slick.</p>

<p>The date/time picker.</p>

<p>Look and feel is really solid. The app has a personality.</p>

<p>Loved how smooth everything is; it&#8217;s easy to use/navigate.</p>

<p>Integration with Google Calendar.</p>

<p>Really great UI and slick implementation with the real-time updating and stuff</p>

<p>It&#8217;s quick/responsive and has a very very low learning curve. There&#8217;s no seeming penalty for just diving in and trying it out right away and that&#8217;s super encouraging as a user. </p>

<p>Party planning with voting metrics built in is a great concept</p>

<p>Real-time data is impressive</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>There wasn&#8217;t a signout button. </p>

<p>bro&#8217;s don&#8217;t usually plan, so maybe the audience is wrong, but the product is good.</p>

<p>Great branding/wording</p>

<p>Awesome site!  Love how it all updates in real time. Great job Mike!</p>

<p>The &#8216;bro&#8217; theme was unnecessary. There are several places where gender could have and should have been omitted.</p>

<p>Needs a little bit of copyediting work. &quot;But what is this really about?&quot; is confusing to me.</p>

<ul>
<li>What about the homegirls?</li>
</ul>

<p>Having a party open for anyone to join makes it a little cumbersome from an actual planning/ui perspective - not sure if there are any admin constraints around what makes a part individual or separate from another.</p>

<p>sweet app brah</p>

<p>I wish there were notifications of messages and updates.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love it if I could add an &quot;open event&quot; and see what&#8217;s going on over a map of my city.  Like, if I were planning a 4th of July block party for fireworks, it&#8217;d be cool to just post that up and see who comes.</p>

<p>The UI is a bit confusing between the various sections, and I&#8217;d rather the page show me all the information for the event as a snapshot, rather than expanding individual sections.</p>

<p>I did run into a strange issue where post-login, it told me I needed to log in again to continue creating my event. It allowed me to &quot;add&quot; times that were empty to the list, as well, which was a bit confusing.</p>

<p>Not sure if this beats email, but I might not be the target demographic</p>

<p>I recognize/acknowledge that this is a final project/school project, but the language/attitude of the app almost at every stage of the demo actually made me second guess whether the app was for me. Rager this, homeboys that, and so forth. If it were a production-app, I&#8217;d probably push through and try it anyway, it&#8217;s very compelling! But there&#8217;s still that barrier that makes me second guess which is kind of a bummer. </p>

<p>Why are we restricted to twitter?  I would much rather have a party planning app that is private with the option of posting to twitter</p>

<p>&quot;bro&quot; theme is kinda off-putting</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>The deal probability forecast.  I&#8217;m not sure how &quot;useful&quot; it is, in the strictest sense of the term, but it&#8217;s so <em>neat</em>.</p>

<p>Deal probability is awesome.</p>

<p>Looks great</p>

<p>Projections seems very smart. Not just data aggregation, but actual analysis. Very cool.</p>

<p>Data prediction was neat</p>

<p>This is awesome data.  Wish I understood the math better to figure out how to use it as a tool.  Nice work.</p>

<p>Prediction algorithms are very impressive</p>

<p>the entire app is amazing.  the analytics behind this thing are so cool.  NISARG FOR EMPEROR!</p>

<p>Deal probability, obviously.</p>

<p>Clean, simple, incredibly powerful, MIGHT be something that LS wants to lock down.</p>

<p>The UI is very clean, love how you&#8217;re making use of the data.</p>

<p>Concise summaries of lots of data</p>

<p>The deal prediction system seems like it could be useful.</p>

<p>The predictions!</p>

<p>Projected data</p>

<p>The projections are cool. I want to know how he is calculating the projections.</p>

<p>Deal probability &amp; Fastest growing deals (data) were the most interesting.</p>

<p>Amazing use of predictive logic</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean interface</li>
<li>Nice use of graphs</li>
</ul>

<p>What impressed me the most was how much info can be pulled from our atom feed and once organized how much can be inferred. </p>

<p>I also liked the &quot;forecasting&quot; of a future deal. </p>

<p>Easily understandable and links out to actual deals so you could see full deal details. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great start toward something that is directly applicable to the kinds of things we want to know about day to day. Would be very interesting to turn on the Groupon scraping. :)</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>Dude crunches numbers.  I&#8217;m impressed.</p>

<p>Didn&#8217;t necessarily go into the technical prominence/prowess of the muscle behind the site, wish he had, there&#8217;s too much under the hood to not talk about</p>

<p>There was clearly so much data work on the backend, but some omissions in the UX make it hard to use. I don&#8217;t get how the &quot;deal probability&quot; search needs to be formatted.</p>

<p>not 100% sure I understand the audience for this, but I think it gives interesting insights into how the deals perform.</p>

<p>UI is pretty basic, kinda table-heavy. Not clear how the UI relates to the use case. Test coverage is pretty weak.</p>

<p>I think the core of this is incredibly powerful and can serve the company well.</p>

<p>Now that we have the information, what interesting things can we do with it? </p>

<p>I think wanted to see the lowest performing deals.  Once a deal goes live, successful deals don&#8217;t need any interaction from the production team.  Low performing deals should be swapped out with better deals.   </p>

<ul>
<li>Could make context a bit more clear in the data areas. For instance, indicating that the revenue data is based on one week&#8217;s performance</li>
<li>Minor UI &quot;nice-to-have&quot;: ability to sort the data (might want to see lowest performers first)</li>
<li>On the revenue pages, would have been nice to see current revenue in addition to projected, and maybe update with actual revenue when the deal ends</li>
</ul>

<h3>Horace Williams - Escaper Caper</h3>

<p>UI: 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>beautiful layout</p>

<p>The design is fantastic, but I&#8217;m not sure how useful it is. It&#8217;s a tough thing to have recommendations and such that aren&#8217;t crap, but I would have liked to see a few items a bit more relevant to the escape and not just pictures.</p>

<p>I like the themed escapes selection; it seems like this would be a neat way to start getting ideas for an escape I&#8217;d be interested in.</p>

<p>The shapes, colors, and photo integrations are awesome.</p>

<p>Love the Design</p>

<p>Integration with photos makes for a pretty site.</p>

<p>The photo display, the simplicity.</p>

<p>This is such a better UI to escapes than the shitty one we have now.</p>

<p>Lots of potential!</p>

<p>The front end on this thing is amazing.  Love the splash page and love the icons.  This is a really cool add on to escapes</p>

<p>Very visually impressive, great overall design</p>

<p>This is a cool app, if for nothing else than to see more of the places we&#8217;re trying to send people.</p>

<p>Looks great when lots of photos come up with an escape.</p>

<p>Seems like a cool way to get excited about going on a LS Escape</p>

<ul>
<li>Really like pulling in other users&#8217; contributions to create the experience or description for the escape</li>
<li>Category navigation is simple and intuitive</li>
</ul>

<p>The animations and the styling in general.</p>

<p>The dotted underlines and the scrolly javascript</p>

<p>UX was awesome.</p>

<p>Simple to use, and like the alternate take on presenting escapes info.</p>

<p>I really like pulling in available media/info from already-existing sites to get a sense of a venue beyond just the LS Editorial; it&#8217;s a great idea and one we ought to use!</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the seemingly random blending of pictures and destinations.  It feels cluttered or disorganized there.</p>

<p>I wish it had about one more day of attention on UX. Some of the scales are difficult &#8211; icons/text that are too big or too large. It&#8217;d be nice to keep the deal attached to the top of the screen as you scroll down.</p>

<p>Great work!</p>

<p>I think this is a great idea to make escapes easier to understand and more desirable.  Probably needs more features to be a &quot;real product&quot;, but there&#8217;s good vision here.  Like it.</p>

<p>Not sure what I&#8217;d really use it for, though I think that it could be a nice supplement to Escapes overall.</p>

<p>Icons feel a little like &quot;mystery meat navigation&quot; &#8211; not always clear what they represent. </p>

<ul>
<li>Would like a link to see another escape in the same category without having to click an icon in the main nav again</li>
<li>Would be cool to see some metadata for photos on hover (e.g., posted date or username or source)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>Good tie between ls vertical and an oft-used idea (dating). Makes something original.</p>

<p>solves an old problem in a new way</p>

<p>The filtering to make sure your date is relevant. That&#8217;s really slick.</p>

<p>Unique. Interesting concept and has legitimacy. Nice work</p>

<p>The part where I get to drink scotch</p>

<p>The design and interface on the app is really slick.  the instagram integration is really well done.  good job!</p>

<p>The Deals integration.</p>

<p>Great concept, easy to use, great UI, again, another app that I could see easily deployed live with a little polish.</p>

<p>The UI is nice and responsive.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how he did it, but the algorithm to select only deals which would make good dates does an amazing job.  I&#8217;d go on just about all of these with my wife.</p>

<p>Great use of deals data</p>

<p>this is cool, tried to link instagram got a 400 json page.  </p>

<p>Really clever. I like that the list of dates is curated for you.</p>

<p>Inline editing on profile page.</p>

<p>Sells deals</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration of activities/live events as the focus of the date</li>
<li>simple messaging feature</li>
<li>profile customization is always awesome!</li>
</ul>

<p>Very good app. UI is responsive and clean. It has good design, but needs a bit more UX &#8211; things look good, but don&#8217;t always match up with my expectations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Awesome concept + has great potential</li>
<li>Slick interface + Ajax</li>
</ul>

<p>I like that it uses LivingSocial deals to build a dating site.</p>

<p>has real world application potential</p>

<p>The profile form page is really nice. I like that making dates is quick and easy (only a couple of clicks).</p>

<p>easy way to import pictures, bringing deals and dates together and finding dates within a mile range.</p>

<p>I need a girlfriend - this might help.</p>

<p>Good overall concept - stepping into a market that has user behavior that exists, but isn&#8217;t quite yet saturated.</p>

<p>Great UI</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>No qualms overall.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t get instagram linking to work, nor could I edit anything on my profile.  I am also many years out of the dating game, so I don&#8217;t know how well this would work. I like centering it around specific activities instead of generic interests.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get this feed of date ideas without having a profile?  Because I&#8217;d like to have a list of date-night ideas for me and my wife, but if I went and made a dating profile online I&#8217;d have some &#8216;splainin&#8217; to do&#8230; :D</p>

<p>Seems useful</p>

<p>it&#8217;d be cool if people were cool basing new relationships on 50% discounts, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>Interface looks like it could use a little more thought/love, other than that very solid.</p>

<p>Got an instagram oauth exception: {
code: 400,
error<em>type: &quot;OAuthException&quot;,
error</em>message: &quot;You must include a valid client<em>id, response</em>type, and redirect_uri parameters&quot;
}</p>

<p>Instagram auth url: <a href="https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fthedailydate.com%2Fusers%2Fauth%2Finstagram%2Fcallback&scope=basic">https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fthedailydate.com%2Fusers%2Fauth%2Finstagram%2Fcallback&amp;scope=basic</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I think that the &quot;find a date&quot; page could be more focused on the activity, not the user&#8230;was a little confused about what I was supposed to look for on this page since the user&#8217;s profile picture dominated each listing</li>
<li>could be cool if you could do some sort of filtering on the find a date page like you can on the post a date page</li>
</ul>

<p>With a few man-months of work, this could be a great startup.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s some kind of font/sizing issue on input fields. </p>

<p>Some of the instagram seems a little buggy - got several JSON 400&#8217;s from the Instagram API when trying to link it.</p>

<p>Only thing about dating sites are personal safety and trusting of the individual posting or taking a date. Vetting on either side is not an easy thing.</p>

<p>Didn&#8217;t get to see any of the interface for receiving / responding messages, but up front experience is well thought out.</p>

<p>When looking for a date, you&#8217;re striking a balance between the person and the activity.  I would actually create 2 views for this: one focusing exclusively on the activity, and one focusing exclusively on the person.  Then allow the user to see the full information after one click.  While you&#8217;re focusing on the experience side of creating a dating experience - many people will still want the traditional view; and for where you&#8217;re trying to create the experience based browsing - go all in.</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>Mobile UI</p>

<p>Nice and fast. Basic idea is solid, and would love to see it far more fleshed out. But I&#8217;m slightly confused when navigating the site about what I&#8217;m supposed to do, and would love to see a vote count as well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a very simple interface - it&#8217;s perfect for the mindframe I&#8217;m likely to be in when I&#8217;m in the mood to use this.</p>

<p>I like the pairings a lot, but even more I like how there can be user generated content. </p>

<p>Simplistic in a good way.</p>

<p>Cute proof of concept, good idea.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s probably the most &#8216;fun&#8217; and accessible that we&#8217;ve seen - minimal interaction, fun app, could easily be something brought to production.</p>

<p>Fun to see what suggestions are generated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Great idea</li>
<li>Cant use it on my android :(</li>
</ul>

<p>The content is good and makes it a lot of fun to explore. UI is straightforward and gets the job done. Got to love the cat snuggler.</p>

<p>Very simple and focussed.  Easy to get the point of and use</p>

<p>Very simple, useful, and fun man.</p>

<p>That it&#8217;s awesome. I really like the fact that you can like a theme but ask for new recommendations. Really cool!</p>

<p>I could actually see myself using this tonight</p>

<p>The ability to create your own night.</p>

<p>Neat idea, not sure how much I would use it in real life. With some tweaks and variations (maybe another activity thrown in to make it a trio) it could be helpful.</p>

<p>Perfect technology pairing (mobile, T&amp;D, movies).</p>

<ul>
<li>like the focus on mobile</li>
<li>simple app, love the categories</li>
</ul>

<p>I really like the &quot;right night, wrong details&quot; button that lets you cycle through a theme without having to start all over again. Creating your own night is a very very close second to that. Good stuff. </p>

<p>I like being suggested things to do</p>

<p>Great job Tom!!!</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>There&#8217;s something odd that happens when I&#8217;m scrolling on the iPhone - I touch to scroll in teh main menu and it highlights(with black) the text. It&#8217;s a little janky.</p>

<p>This feels like the seed of a great idea.  I feel like this deserves a chance at a round of user testing and some feature additions.</p>

<p>I could see myself using this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to see a version 2.0 with more detail, a little more smoothing of the design/api.</p>

<p>I think you could easily enhance this to be &quot;stay in/go out&quot; and for the &quot;go out&quot; case, show restaurants/deals near theaters with movies you&#8217;re going to see.  Anyway, nice work!</p>

<p>GREAT JOB!</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>UI seems fairly responsive.</p>

<p>Nice way to combine separate content streams with LS deals</p>

<p>The Amazon catalog integration.</p>

<p>the search and speed is fantastic. would have loved to see a fixed video window along with the instructions so you can see both at once. the font is a bit too high-tech but the flow is quite nice.</p>

<p>Good job.  The js front end is really slick.  Really wise use of caching.  </p>

<p>The way you handle the search from Howcast is great. Also the value proposition is really clear.</p>

<p>basically takes how cast and turns it into what it should be doing already.  looks well integrated.</p>

<p>Great use of variety of data</p>

<ul>
<li>I like the suggested search results in the right column after you search for a term</li>
<li>Love the suggested products to complete the project</li>
<li>App is responsive and pretty fast</li>
<li>Like that you improved the search so it&#8217;s better than Howcast&#8217;s default search</li>
</ul>

<p>A nice and simple mashup that improves the experience of the sites being mashed-up</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance issues sometimes</li>
<li>Nice &amp; Clean</li>
<li>Much better alternative to howcast.</li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoyed Andrews solution for dealing with the crappy howcast search, very smart.</p>

<p>The adjusted search results</p>

<p>The design of pulling information from the background - video caching is something that I wouldn&#8217;t have thought to do at all, but the logic behind saving queries and loading existing data is really smart.</p>

<p>Great UI</p>

<p>Has a great tie-in with at-home deals, interface is simple and snappy.</p>

<p>I like the videos and the steps to build things. Maybe if the amazon items were more prominent it would be better. </p>

<p>The premise &#8211; tying together everything from the howto to the purchasing of the materials needed, is something that would definitely be useful.</p>

<p>How random the things that get returned for searches.  I searched for &quot;shed&quot; &amp; I got back a bunch of links for losing weight (&quot;shedding pounds&quot;).</p>

<p>Pretty small learning curve, which is great. </p>

<p>Style came out very nicely.</p>

<p>Interesting way of caching responses to prevent rate limiting.  </p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>I feel like it&#8217;s really just a skin of how cast with advertisements.</p>

<p>Some strange search behavior (&quot;shelves&quot; brought up &quot;How to make a Campari and Soda&quot; and &quot;How to Sell Anything to Anybody&quot;)</p>

<p>You should give some pointers to HowCast on how to implement search. :D</p>

<p>The font for the headers seems to bleed a bit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tips should probably be de-emphasized a little bit or be given a different treatment so they don&#8217;t distract from main steps of the project</li>
<li>Could put the tutorial title at the top of the content area (once the video starts you lose the title)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this is a good idea, though the &quot;how to&quot; things that are listed are a bit more broad than just home improvements.  I&#8217;d either restrict those to just home improvement products or change the concept to be more broad.</p>

<p>At any rate, nice work.</p>

<p>Wish he wasn&#8217;t constrained by howcast, feel like there&#8217;s a broader &#8216;todo&#8217; net to be cast out there.</p>

<p>The asynchronous loading is distracting because it doesn&#8217;t perform well. Since there isn&#8217;t any feedback while the page is loading, it makes the site seem really slow.</p>

<p>I found the search results to be somewhat counterintuitive &#8211; not so much a fault of the app, most likely, but a problem with the choice of backend. Likewise with the product listings.</p>

<p>Minor note &#8211; the amazon prices displayed are the &quot;retail&quot; price, not the real for sale price which is normally much later.</p>

<h3>Mark Tabler - Ferrety</h3>

<p>UI: 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 4</p>

<p>VALUE_PROPOSITION: 4, 4, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4</p>

<h4>Your Favorite Thing</h4>

<p>The value proposition. Information filtering is increasingly valuable to me.</p>

<p>simplicity, flexibility</p>

<p>Love how easy it is to add new ferrets/information schemes as you work</p>

<p>I like the simplicity, but it might be a bit too visually simple.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simplistic</p>

<p>The automation is cool, though I&#8217;m not sure how useful it is at the end of the day.</p>

<p>The background architecture/code behind everything.</p>

<p>Simplicity.</p>

<p>I do like that he kept the app really simple.  It keeps with his theme of having one place to get all information in a quick fashion</p>

<p>I like the simplicity.</p>

<p>Nice idea to keep the ui simple and straight forward. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s very simple and just works.</p>

<p>Simple, easy to use.</p>

<p>Convenience of information access via email</p>

<p>The decomposition and service design sounds well done. The idea of aggregating the info into one package is a win, especially as more things come online. I realize the emphasis was not on design, but it would be nice if there was a little more to the daily emails to give users something to get attached to.</p>

<p>Places a general interface over very specific data; a tough problem to solve.</p>

<p>Really awesome app that I am actually using now!  Definitely delivers really well on it&#8217;s value proposition.  I like how the &#8216;honey badger&#8217; is scalable to collect many different types on information</p>

<p>The bottom nav &amp; the ferret image.</p>

<ul>
<li>Email notifications are cool, and don&#8217;t try to do too much</li>
<li>UI was very simple</li>
<li>The logo!!</li>
</ul>

<p>Impressive work making the app distributed!</p>

<p>The mascot is pretty awesome. :) The general premise is also really useful.</p>

<p>Great way to only consume data that you want.</p>

<p>I like the concept of getting only relevant info, and scheduling something to go get it.</p>

<p>I really like the no-email-unless-your-criteria-match aspect. It sounds… simple, but it&#8217;s a thing so many apps fail at <em>or</em> don&#8217;t allow fine-enough control to get right. Really nicely done. </p>

<p>Mobile, real-time</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of great pieces, but as far as delivering on the value I&#8217;m not sure. I think you could definitely rework the app into something that was more of an event/activity planner that would work better than a dating site.</p>

<p>I like the integration of instagram and the workflow.</p>

<p>Interesting concept.</p>

<p>I like the one-stop-shopping.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a salesperson, so I don&#8217;t know for sure - but I <em>think</em> this has the potential to make a lot of peoples&#8217; jobs a lot easier.</p>

<p>simple but extremely useful</p>

<p>The concept is awesome.</p>

<p>The concept and execution: I have also wanted to understand an area before buying an Escape to it.</p>

<h4>Other Comments</h4>

<p>Good job.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>I do enjoy getting an email every morning telling me that it is going to be a scorcher.</p>

<p>I like the daily email and that you can make it what you want it.</p>

<p>Great name.</p>

<p>Lacking a good empty-state interface.</p>

<p>Although he kept things simple, I would have liked to see items more distinguishable amongst categories</p>

<p>Lots of ideas I&#8217;d love to see in &quot;version 2&quot; like live results, popular ferrets, etc.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what information to enter into the text fields. The buttons look like they are disabled because they are gray. It would be nice to have some feed back on the reports page about when I will see information. Right now it&#8217;s a blank page and I don&#8217;t know if the worker is running or not.</p>

<p>Not entirely intuitive, especially when you sign in. I think a lot could be done to make it easier to create additional ferrets, but it is a great idea. Nice work.</p>

<p>Value will greatly increase as more services are added.</p>

<p>The simple UI is ok for the use-case, but the navbar at the bottom is a bit of a mistake. I found myself clicking the &quot;Ferrety&quot; link several times without realizing that anything had changed since the navbar was hidden under the chrome mouseover url.</p>

<p>Interface for adding new ferrets seems somewhat complex.</p>

<p>I dont think this grading scale worked to the benefit of ferrety.  It&#8217;s design/ui isn&#8217;t &#8216;totally amazing&#8217;, but the architecture behind it is extremely impressive- I dont think the points given here are indicative of Mark&#8217;s awesome work.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Kind of goes against UX patterns to have the nav at the bottom; it was pretty small and not noticeable</li>
</ul>

<p>For the weather widget, might be useful to give some kind of indication of what values are relevant under &quot;watch for conditions&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Would love to have a shorter schedule period where updates run more than once a day.  Pending jobs aren&#8217;t displayed and it was hard for me to tell if what I entered as a report was working correctly.  </p>

<p>Would&#8217;ve liked to see a few more things than weather and stock, like RSS feeds, but the concept came through very well.</p>

<p>Ferrety would be friends with Hipmunk. That&#8217;s not a constructive comment, but a thought nonetheless. (: </p>

<p>Great demo!</p>

<p>Some of the styling was a bit confusing, and the UI could have used a bit of polish, but with so many pages and pieces already it came together pretty well.</p>

<p>UI is basic, functional, but not always clear. Cute ferret icon.</p>

<p>The amazon search needs a bit of refinement, but it does some pretty good guessing for a V1 app.</p>

<p>The only complaint that I have is that when you first get to a market, the map is overcrowded with icons.  I know we have to start somewhere, and it&#8217;s better to have some data on the map than to have a blank slate - but maybe the default parameters could be set to some common search that salespersons would find useful, so as not to make the initial screen so intimidating?</p>

<p>Homepage after login is confusing. The UX needs a little more work.</p>

<p>Would be great to see this integrated into Escapes proper.</p>
