<h3>Daniel Kaufman</h3>

<ul>
<li>Technologies: S3, Raphael.js</li>
<li>Integrations: Last.FM, gCal</li>
<li>LivingSocial: 918 F. Street</li>
<li><p>Concept: Bar Trivia</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li>What problem is it going to solve?
918 is looking for more ways to get people in the building, more consistently. Bar trivia would bring additional people into the bar space, without any additional cost. However, in doing so, Living Social should make sure to differentiate themselves from they typical DC bar that does trivia on weeknights. One way to do so is with a sleek, modern trivia experience that would stand in sharp contrast to the typical clumsy method.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol>
<li>Elevator Pitch:
LivingSocial is a cutting edge tech company and a leader in local events, and the way they do trivia should reflect this. Currently basically all bar trivia is run with scraps of paper and excel spreadsheets. Each question starts with people shouting at the organizer to repeat the question. Then, each team scrambles to write their team name and answer on a scrap of paper, without much idea of how long they have. Finally, one member of the group must fight his or her way through the crowd to hand the answer to the organizer. Scores are tallied in an Excel spreadsheet, with plenty of errors and wait times. LivingSocial, in contrast, can offer a sleek, technological solution, where players can use their mobile phones to read questions, submit answers without rushing across the room, and know their scores instantly.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol>
<li>Core Features
a. A lightweight front facing website that updates automatically to display new questions and when the time to answer questions is over.
b. A more robust dashboard view for the organizer, which could also be displayed on a big screen at the bar.
c. Realtime communication between the two above components.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tom Kiefhaber</h3>

<li>Technologies:  jQuery Mobile, Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Integrations:  Spotify, Netflix</li>
<li>LivingSocial:  Takeout &amp; Delivery</li>
<li>Concept:  Date night.<br></li>
<li>Problem:  LS is all about curating experience, but T&amp;D more transactional.  Seamless can deliver food.  We need to make ordering food more just another meal.</li>
<li>Elevator: What goes better with Good Fellas than some lasagna and garlic bread?  Got a hankering for some tandoori chicken?  Spice it up with some Slumdog Millionaire.
        We&#8217;re going to transcend your night on the couch into a night you&#8217;ll never forget.</li>
<li>Core Features:  Fetch currently available menus and categories, access netflix for genre search. In the future? Spotify playlists.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jan Koszewski</h3>

<ul>
<li>Technologies: Websockets, Processing.js</li>
<li>Integrations: Twitter, Gmail</li>
<li>LivingSocial: Local Deals</li>
<li>Concept: Local Deal Twitter Feed Analytic Tool</li>
<li>Planning:

<ol>
<li>Problem: Measuring a Deal&#8217;s impact through social media and meaningfully engaging with people who talk about a Local Deals is difficult.  There is no tool that quickly synthesizes, assesses, and gives feedback about a Deal&#8217;s performance leveraged against its social media presence in real-time.</li>
<li>Elevator: Quickly guage the twitter impact of a Deal in real-time; see who is tweeting about a deal and their social media presence as measured by their Klout score leveraged against the performance of the deal overall.  Strategically engage with people who tweet about a deal to boost that deal&#8217;s overall success and @livingsocial&#8217;s profile.</li>
<li>Core Features: It must be able to (1) retrieve tweets about a specific deal in real-time (or match tweets to @livingsocial against a specific Local Deal), (2) retrieve the Klout score for the person or organizatoin who tweeted about the deal, (3) periodically scrape the livingsocial.com/cities.atom feed to retrieve purchasing data about all Local Deals being run for the day, and (4) visually present the collected information about a the twitterer and the deal in a way that is at once meaningful and useful to people who manage the social media presence of a Local Deal.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>Christopher Maddox</h3>

<ul>
<li>Technologies: Big Data, &gt;= 3 programming languages</li>
<li>Integrations: Twitter, Amazon Marketplace</li>
<li>LivingSocial: Local Deals</li>
<li>Planning

<ul>
<li>Problem: LivingSocial has some of the greatest engineers on the planet, and yet our core business is sales and advertising. We send out 1 deal/market/day, but I don&#8217;t need 70% of what they send me.</li>
<li>Pitch: Let&#8217;s start building verticals that don&#8217;t have to do with deals, but that drives taffic to our core business. We can get tons of user data for better personalization by encouraging users to integrate their social networks with us.</li>
<li>Core Features: Twitter, Facebook, Deals integration (as ads).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Conan Rimmer</h3>

<ul>
<li>Technologies: jQuery Mobile, Amazon S3</li>
<li>Integrations: Foursquare, Google Maps</li>
<li>LivingSocial: Takeout &amp; Delivery (TOAD)</li>
<li>Planning:

<ol>
<li>Problem:  Planning &amp; coordinating a party is hard.  Inviting others, finding food for the party, &amp; seeing who showed up is even more difficult.</li>
<li>Elevator:  Plan your next party using fourinstants.  Setup a Foursquare event, invite friends, &amp; get a list of nearby LS Takeout &amp; Delivery (TOAD) restaurants to cater the event.  See when your friends arrive via Foursquare check-ins.</li>

<li>LivingSocial: takeout and delivery</li>
<li>Concept: Last-Minute Get Together</li>
<li><p>Planning:</p>

<ol>
<li>Problem: It is difficult to coordinate groups for an impromptu dinner party. Ease the situation by giving users the ability to pick a restaurant from T&amp;D then send invites over twitter, and if enough people respond to it within a certain time, provide options for picking up party favors (ordering food through takeout and delivery, decorations, etc.)</li>
<li>Elevator: No one likes eating alone, and no one likes last-minute planning. By using &quot;PartyPlanner&quot;, you can pick out a food type for dinner then send out an invite through twitter. If enough people do reply within a certain timeframe, receive information on where to pick up food, decorations, etc; if enough people do not reply, no energy was wasted on setting up the party.</li>
<li>Core Features: It must allow users to signin and post using Twitter.  It must also retrieve info from LS site about restaurants available for T&amp;D. To keep with the time branding, it must also have a countdown upon post. It must also consume replies to know if enough people have responded.  Upon response, it must show where to pick up items around his or her area using google maps.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<li>Integrations: GitHub &amp; LinkedIn</li>
<li>LivingSocial: Local Deals</li>
<li>Concept: Analytics for local deals</li>
<li> Planning:

<ol>
<li>Problem: LivingSocial and Groupon have no way to pull historical data. In order to provide any sort of analytics or competitive analysis, this kind of data is necessary.</li>
<li>Elevator: This site will help people get easy access to daily deals data as well as provide analysis on deal performance across various markets and categories.</li>
<li>Core features: Needs to be able to fetch and scrape data from both Groupon and LivingSocial.</li>

<li>LivingSocial: At Home</li>
<li>Concept: Content Digest system - given a set of parameters, goes out and checks a list of services at given intervals looking for matches. When matches are found, they are compiled into a digest for delivery and review at some later date.</li>
<li>Planning:

<ol>
<li>Problem: It&#8217;s too easy to spend an hour every morning surfing a collection of sites looking for interesting news, and still miss pieces you&#8217;d have liked to know.</li>
<li>Elevator: Ferrety does your daily info gathering legwork for you, so you can spend more time reading and less time surfing.</li>
<li>Core Features: Daily digest email with links to pages meeting search criteria specified on user dashboard.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>Travis Valentine</h3>

<li>Technologies: Elastic Search, Raphael.js</li>
<li>Integrations: Last.fm, LinkedIn</li>
<li>LivingSocial: Escapes</li>
<li>Concept: A better roadtrip experience with music playlists and maybe some other recommendations en route.</li>
<li>Planning:

<ol>
<li>Problem: Escapes is all about a destination experience, but it doesn&#8217;t take into account the worst part of going on one: the trip.</li>
<li>Elevator: Rdtrip focuses on making the trip more memorable so the journey is as fun as the destination.</li>

<ol>
<li>Problem: It&#8217;s hard to get an idea of what a city is like if you&#8217;re not there.</li>
<li>Elevator: By pulling in info from various social services coupled with demographic data, users can learn about a given city before deciding to visit or move there.</li>
<li>Core Features: A search for a given city returns info on weather, local deals, job activity, where people hang out, and what they care about.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>Edward Weng</h3>

<li>Technologies: JS Front-end, Big Data</li>
<li>Integrations: 4Square, LinkedIn</li>
<li>LivingSocial: Local Deals</li>
<li>Concept: Website that facilitates meeting new people locally through daily deals.</li>
<li>Planning:

<ol>
<li>Problem: People want to go to events and purchase local deals but sometimes can&#8217;t find people to go with them.</li>
<li>Elevator: This site would help you find other people who are interested in participating in a deal and help you connect with them.</li>
<li>Core features: It needs to be able to fetch and scrape data periodically (hourly intervals) from the local deals website. We need to be able to manage all of this data.</li>

<li>Planning:

<ol>
<li>Problem: People are interested in travel experiences that feel unique and personal, but the current method for displaying Escapes doesn&#8217;t adequately convey this aspect of the product.</li>
<li>Elevator: LivingSocial has an opportunity to broker travel experiences that feel special to consumers. To do this we need to help people imagine themselves on the escape, which is what this site would aim to do.</li>
<li>Core features: &#8211; Scrape Escapes data to present base content &#8211; Pull relevant &quot;flavor&quot; data from Flickr; Possible extensions could be Amazon Reading List, other product/theme experience integrations</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Concept: Plan your Dream Wedding with SomethingBlue</li>
<li>Planning: </li>
<li>Problem: Weddings involve hundreds of coordinated parts and thousands of individual decisions. Current wedding planning sites are outdated and don&#8217;t act as effective idea-building tools. SomethingBlue is the first online planning tool that allows you to imagine and design your wedding, from beginning to end.</li>
<li>Elevator Pitch: Imagine, plan and share your dream wedding with SomethingBlue.</li>
