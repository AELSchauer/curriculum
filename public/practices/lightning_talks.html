    <p>What is a lightning talk? It&#8217;s a short presentation that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lasts five minutes</li>
<li>Delivers a message</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lightning Talk Process</h3>

<ul>
<li>On Friday, a week before the talk, meet as a group to brainstorm and select topics</li>
<li>On Monday, bring a brain-dump of ideas and facts gathered through research</li>
<li>For Tuesday, prepare an outline of the talk&#8217;s structure (<em>outline suggestions below</em>)</li>
<li>For Wednesday, prepare a rough-draft (with slides, if you&#8217;ll use them) to walk through</li>
<li>On Thursday, conduct a rehearsal in front of the talk group</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outlining a Lightning Talk</h3>

<p>One of the things that&#8217;s great about lightning talks is that five minutes can only go so wrong. It is an opportunity to be experimental.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong>, until you have your feet under you as a speaker, we suggest adopting one of the tried-and-true patterns of successful talks. The most common goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Problem Statement</li>
<li>Problem Argument</li>
<li>Solution</li>
<li>Demonstration / Solution Argument</li>
<li>Resolution</li>
<li>Leave Behind / Next Steps</li>
</ul>

<p>Is that a lot to fit in 5 minutes? You bet!</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>

<p>Why should the audience bother listening to your talk? How does this material connect with them? The problem statement should be challenging or combative enough to draw them in. </p>

<h4>Problem Argument</h4>

<p>A great talk typically does not fit for everyone, assert your problem and solution with authority. Start an argument.</p>

<p>Who does this apply to? What evidence do you see of the problem? Why is the problem worth solving?</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>&quot;TA-DA, I have the cure for your ills!&quot; Bring it with gusto. You have to believe this is going to change their lives.</p>

<h4>Demonstration / Solution Argument</h4>

<p>You&#8217;ve dropped the solution concept on them, now you need to back it up. Here&#8217;s what it looks like when you use this tool. Here&#8217;s how you think differently when you have this knowledge or skill.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t give soft platitudes. Grab them by the shirt collar and yell. In the literary world, this is your climax.</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve enacted this solution, this is what you&#8217;ll get. You&#8217;re bringing the energy down a bit, focusing on the wonderful new world where the tool has been adopted or skill mastered.</p>

<h4>Leave Behind / Next Steps</h4>

<p>But compel them to act. Your talk should end with a suggestion or an action. Introducing a tool? Announce a meetup where you&#8217;ll dig into it step-by-step. Discussing a skill? What&#8217;s the essential follow-up reading where they can learn more about it.</p>

<p>Make sure to leave the leave-behind up while your presentation closes and the audience claps. It can, if you so choose, be well combined with your name/title/contact info in one single closing slide.</p>

<h3>Things to Keep in Mind</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s imagine that I&#8217;m putting together a lightning talk about the Pomodoro Technique.</p>

<h4>A Topic Is Not A Purpose</h4>

<p>A purpose is not the same as a topic. My topic is &quot;Pomodoro techique,&quot; but my purpose would be something like this:</p>

<p>| Convince developers that working in short bursts with frequent breaks is more productive than marathon work sessions</p>

<p>The purpose leads you to the conclusion of your talk. What is the <em>one thing</em> that your audience must walk away with?</p>

<h4>Starting Point</h4>

<ul>
<li>Who&#8217;s in the audience? </li>
<li>What do they already know about this topic? </li>
<li>Are they already convinced of the purpose? If so, don&#8217;t give the talk!</li>
</ul>

<p>In my example, I&#8217;m speaking to 24 developers who have probably just started using pomodoros in the past week. They understand the mechanics, but not much about the message. Some of them think it&#8217;s cool because you get lots of coffee breaks, but others think it&#8217;s a waste of time. All of them probably think I&#8217;m unnecessarily a hardass about the start and end of pomodoros.</p>

<h4>Support Your Argument</h4>

<p>What arguments will I make to move the audience from the Starting Point to the Purpose/Conclusion?</p>

<ul>
<li>Health problems with sitting, reduced by frequent walking</li>
<li>&quot;Exclusionary time&quot; where you focus on one thing</li>
<li>Multi-tasking is a myth</li>
<li>Tracking time via pomodoros</li>
<li>Break time is (background) work time</li>
<li>Dangers of sloppy clock management</li>
</ul>

<h4>Presentation Style</h4>

<p>Lightning talks are so short that you have many options for a presentation style:</p>

<ul>
<li>Naked: no support, just you and a mic. Strictly for stone cold presentation dominators.</li>
<li>Text-Based: The easiest to construct. Distil your key concepts down to small fragements or phrases and use Keynote to present them one after another. Generally use <em>six or fewer</em> words per slide.</li>
<li>Image-Based: Use only images with no text. This is really a riff on the naked talk because you have to remember what you&#8217;re supposed to be saying without the text on screen to drive you.</li>
<li>Text/Image Hybrid: The most common, some text, some images, usually a meme or two. It was cool in 2010, now it&#8217;s a little&#8230;standard.</li>
<li>Performance: The only thing more avant-garde than a naked talk is a performance talk: slam poetry, series of haikus, interpretive dance, original song, live drawing, or a group activity. You won&#8217;t be forgotten, but with a short time it&#8217;s difficult to deliver on your purpose.</li>
<li>Story time: Regardless of your overall presentation style, telling a story is a great way to connect with people while illustrating your point</li>
</ul>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<ul>
<li>Run through your lightning talk at least three times.  You&#8217;ll have much more confidence and your audience will appreciate the preparation.</li>
<li>Make sure you can cover everything you want to within the five minute time limit.</li>
<li>If you can, run through the presentation in front of another person.  They&#8217;ll pick up things you would never notice on your own.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What Not to Do</h4>

<p>Here are some of the common things that new presenters do which slaughter their credibility/purpose:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t start off by discrediting your work with a comment like &quot;Not sure how this is going to go, I&#8217;ve been up since 3am putting it together&quot;</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t spend all your time looking at the ceiling, floor, or projector. Look at your audience, glance at your materials as necessary.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget that Keynote offers a &quot;presenter view&quot; where you see what&#8217;s coming next before the audience</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use a bunch of fancy transitions and effects unless they&#8217;re ironic. Most everything &quot;3D&quot; is off limits.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t put full sentences on a slide, ever.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t put long quotes then proceed to read them to the audience. Just use the author&#8217;s photo and read it from your notes.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget your purpose. If there&#8217;s no takeaway, then there&#8217;s no point.</li>
</ul>
