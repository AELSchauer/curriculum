    <h2>Group 1</h2>

<p>analytics is cool. interface is too cluttered. fast though.</p>

<p>very cool.  good looking.  pretty straight forward chat app, but it&#8217;s well executed and easy to use.</p>

<p>Not sure what makes this &quot;speakeasy&quot;.  I only half-get the wood panel motif.  The splash page suggests this is not your average chat, but that&#8217;s exactly what it looks like to me.</p>

<p>good job!  slick interface!</p>

<p>The analytics are awesome. Lots of features, which is cool, including search and github integration. I&#8217;m confused about what the theme is, though - it just has a lot in it. </p>

<p>I created a login with my @hungrymachine address, and then attempted to signup with my @livingsocial - and it said the latter was already taken. The room list was empty.</p>

<p>Very solid, needs about a week of polish.</p>

<p>&quot;it just works&quot;</p>

<p>great idea, well executed. The theme was consistent and just overall fantastic.</p>

<p>A completely unbiased opinion&#8230; :)</p>

<p>Very nice. The functioning of the chat interface is really well-executed. If anything, I think the github/project integration could have been more emphasized. The chat features are a really solid base and it would be nice to layer a little deeper functionality on top of that. </p>

<p>freakin amazing as well, really fun to play with</p>

<p>I like the overall concept and there are some great bits in there. It does seem to be overloaded by large messages at times - it hung and crashed my browser at first.</p>

<p>analytics is cool. interface is too cluttered. fast though.</p>

<h3>Final Round</h3>

<p>Simple and clean.</p>

<p>Search indexing causes app to hang?  I like the git integration.  It&#8217;s a solid implementation of chat otherwise.</p>

<p>nice. easy to use. not overcomplicated, does what it does well.</p>

<p>&quot;• Once I logged out I couldn&#8217;t log in
• No automatic email sent.
• When inviting it was within the system only, should send an email regardless of they have an account and invite them
• No forgot password - Which I did or mistyped it. BTW: NO PASSWORD CONFIRMATION!!!!</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t continue to test because my password didn&#8217;t match and I couldn&#8217;t log in. I liked that you integrated github, just wish I could&#8217;ve tried it.&quot;</p>

<p>Love analytics. Site is super fast. UI slightly messy (no wood panelling!!) Not sure what github has to do with this site. Shouldn&#8217;t have to invite by email address. Would have like image links display inline. Spine bit is very cool.</p>

<p>I like the UI minus the wood panel.  The analytics page is REALLY slick!  I like the github integration</p>

<p>So cool.</p>

<p>&quot;Great job.  Would&#8217;ve loved to have an overview of what the services were and how they worked a bit more, but it looks great.  Analytics is a nice touch.</p>

<p>Liked that you only need the password typed once for signup, but didn&#8217;t like that I had to signup.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why is autofocus on the wrong field? No password confirmation?</p>

<p>Why is the page title &#8216;vaudeville&#8217; ?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m seeing a lot of &quot;&quot;Hmm, couldn&#8217;t find that user in the system&quot;&quot; when trying to invite people.</p>

<p>Each app should have a Readme file that describes the app, not the generic &quot;&quot;Welcome to Rails&quot;&quot; Readme.</p>

<p>Global variable $redis makes me :(</p>

<p>Using Draper just for as_json seems like overkill to me.</p>

<p>I find your lack of tests disturbing. Seriously, there&#8217;s like nearly zero tests here. :(</p>

<p>Front-end design (wood paneling) is very nice, and charts/dashboard interface is a good idea.</p>

<p>&quot;
Solid, sometimes I think search indexing stutters the chat.  Also, wish that finding/adding users was somehow easier - that&#8217;s the only real functional thing that holds this back from being truly awesome.</p>

<p>Really like the aesthetic/theme. The UI is really solid, with the possible exeception that the github integration should be more prominent. It&#8217;s a really solid base as a chat-app and web interface, so it would be cool to see the personalization/github-specificity amped up a bit.</p>

<p>&quot;- Nice concept and brand
- The add user feature was pretty smooth and quick
- Sign up was painless
- Liked the ability to edit room and manage users within the room
&quot;</p>

<p>I like it. I wish that GitHub events showed up in the chat flow. The metrics were cool, but they need some navigation to get back to the normal interface. It&#8217;d be great if they were just a tab on the left side like the chatrooms. Performance lags were a bit of a bummer, but not too bad.</p>

<p>&quot;Fairly well designed, they did a good job of laying out the UI. The github integration is an interesting idea and makes it look like a tool a developer would use. It would be great if you could toggle between pull requests and commits. </p>

<p>Missing/Broken functionality
- No forgot password
- Logout is hard to find (hidden behind a magical drop-down)
- The github commits link to an api endpoint that returns json, rather than the GH UI.&quot;</p>

<h2>Group 2</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m confused about the purpose of the site. The main chat window needs some major styling. Hard to use.</p>

<p>The app is extremely slow, and the importing just hung.  I would like to have seen that happen as a background process.  The chat system doesn&#8217;t post a message when I hit enter, and that&#8217;s very aggravating. </p>

<p>After a few minutes, nothing would load. The concept is cool, though - I like the different branch chats. </p>

<p>Their focus on the theme and purpose of the app was great. That they completely copied GitHub&#8217;s styling was off-putting, piggybacking on a big name isn&#8217;t really what I was looking for.</p>

<p>I wish it worked better :(</p>

<p>&quot;looks like github which is cool.  makes pretty good sense to at first, but is a little confusing at first with master chat and branch chat.  like the app, but not clearing the entry window is a pretty big bug.  still loading on search after 2 minutes.  </p>

<p>really like the idea of this one.  would be useful for github to integrate it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;good working with scoping chat to a feature, pretty creative</p>

<p>&quot;
Performance problems made the experience rough. Had some reservations about the authorization scheme. Great execution of the concept.</p>

<p>Really cool idea with the room branching/master chat tracking. Obviously the stability issues are a problem, but if you could speed it up it could be really cool. I don&#8217;t think you really need to adhere to the github theme so much. It would help a lot to get the UI jazzed up a bit I think.</p>

<p>Really cool feature of chatting on master then branch.</p>

<h2>Group 3</h2>

<p>&quot;Some weird things happening with auto-fill in Chrome that are definitely annoying. It&#8217;s also strange that when I first log in I&#8217;m not in a room, but it LOOKS like I&#8217;m in a room and can chat, etc.</p>

<p>Also a bit of an odd workflow going through to add members, etc - it&#8217;s a lot of button clicks, and the arrangement and positioning of buttons feels a little odd.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t even log in!</p>

<p>Bugs are difficult. The UI/flow really needed some work - it&#8217;s fairly impossible to get other people into your room, which is hard for a chat app.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t login, created many accounts. JavaScript security issues.</p>

<h2>Group 4</h2>

<p>&quot;confused by the castle/old time feel.  seems like it might be tied to something, but it&#8217;s not clear.</p>

<p>like the chat list with the line separations.  like the email function.  git hub integration seems arbitrary.&quot;</p>

<p>design isn&#8217;t great, not too many features. chat itself seemed to work fairly well.</p>

<p>They really nailed it! The UI is great and the concept is clear. It was easy to set up github.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s stable/usable, as opposed to ours.</p>

<p>The email and github features are cool. As is the whitelist, though login is kind of confusing.</p>

<p>Solid but needed a lot more polish/work.</p>

<h2>Group 5</h2>

<p>good job wrangling flash! </p>

<p>I know I&#8217;m not supposed to award &quot;a lot&quot; of fives.  But the video worked <em>immediately</em> upon my entering the room, I didn&#8217;t have to click anything.  The chat receives notifications from the speaker slides so I can follow the flow of feedback about the slides, and it all just <em>worked</em>.  It&#8217;s really amazingly put together.  Before I saw this I wouldn&#8217;t have been convinced it could be done at all.</p>

<p>visual layout isn&#8217;t great. chat window way too smal. site does what it intended to do, which is great. video is neat.</p>

<p>This is FUCKING AWESOME.</p>

<p>wow, this is so freaking good!!</p>

<p>Amazing!</p>

<p>Really nice job on the video. I liked that a lot.</p>

<p>This is super coherent and easy to use.  Nice work!</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t believe their chat kept up at the pace it did, video was very impressive, functionally very simple overall, great design/work.  Best so far, easily.</p>

<p>wow!</p>

<p>Have fun in New York!</p>

<p>actually useful. This is awesome.</p>

<p>Video chat is hands down the coolest feature. Great job, Charles! Also the chat was really smooth and fast&#8230;awesome.</p>

<p>The UI was really busy and distracting. Chat backlog is way too short.</p>

<p>Really, really nice job. A few style quirks that could use a designer to cleanup.</p>

<h3>Final Round</h3>

<p>Really awesome stuff.</p>

<p>This is a very impressive project.  I&#8217;d use this to present a talk remotely.</p>

<p>very cool. can see many real world uses.</p>

<p>&quot;Very nice and handy tool! And something that I can see myself using. </p>

<p>Good to see gmail auth. Great job reaching out to slidedeck team and working with them and a cutting edge API.</p>

<p>I also think you succeeded on focusing on a single task and doing it well.</p>

<p>Few suggestions and I&#8217;d like to see Added: :-)
• Audio only mode
• Scope the deck URL to a user or throw away if that person is not logged in.
• Ability to have a live comment stream for the followers
• View stored video with presentation based on slide.&quot;
Has one solid theme which is nice. UI needs some work. The chat area itself is too small, and you lose chats too quickly. Not many features other than the main chat screen, but that screen is executed well. Slide syncing is very nifty. </p>

<p>honesty&#8230;holy shit.  this is pretty incredible.  toggling presenter mode is pretty damn impressive.  This would be an even amazing product if you could share screen</p>

<p>Video chat is badass. Very nice!</p>

<p>&quot;Loe the features; great idea to have the embedded chat, and the overall concept is really novel and great.</p>

<p>That being said, it seemed buggy in Safari (slides didn&#8217;t advance, camera didn&#8217;t work), and slightly buggy on Chrome (camera didn&#8217;t work).</p>

<p>THAT being said, I think it&#8217;s totally OK because you all were pretty ambitious and more or less pulled it off.</p>

<p>Would have liked to know more about what services you created to make all t his work.</p>

<p>Liked the guest concept, nice work integrating the google auth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a really cool idea.</p>

<p>I was not able to login via Google &#8211; it kept redirecting me to root, then choose a presentation, asked to login again&#8230; Login as guest worked.</p>

<p>Not a lot of tests here. :(</p>

<p>Chattin::Frontend::PresentationsController#create is seriously bloated, and totally untested. :(</p>

<p>Each app should have a Readme file that describes the app, these are mostly blank, which is better than the generic &quot;&quot;Welcome to Rails&quot;&quot;, at least a little, I think, but not a lot.</p>

<p>I like that it&#8217;s very usable. There are minor things to tweak (chat messages seem to disappear under a deluge of unrelated background noise) but they feel really minor. Just seems to work really well, other than that login bug I found.&quot;</p>

<p>Google auth seems to be flaky - I&#8217;ve logged in with my gmail and hungrymachine account before, not sure if I&#8217;ve logged out of either of them, but I can&#8217;t seem to use them again to login.  I have to log in as a guest in order to get access to anything, my auth doesn&#8217;t seem to be retained.  Otherwise this is still the most impressive imho so far.</p>

<p>soapbox! Get video recording! Get speakernotes! sweet idea tho.</p>

<p>You could work on this for 2 more weeks and sell this.</p>

<p>&quot;- Very cool idea, and ties into a real problem experience here at LS
- Was easy to get signed in and started
- The notifications about speaker advancing the slides could be useful, but ended up being rather distracting in the chat box (especially since notifications and chat messages all looked the same)
- Nice touch: ability to control slides at your own pace!&quot;</p>

<p>Concept is very well executed. The design/UI need more work, some parts are hard to read. I can&#8217;t quite see the video, slides, and chat on my screen at the same time. Flash video/audio is amazing. The slide tracking functionality is really good. Playing embedded video would be awesome, too. </p>

<p>&quot;Did a great job of focusing on specific goal with the project and making the experience seamless.</p>

<p>You can see that they put effort into the aesthetics of the design, but certain elements fall apart. On the welcome page it isn&#8217;t clear that the presentations container is scrollable. This element should be more user friendly, possibly by adding arrows or a different UI element that suggests it can be scrolled.</p>

<p>As for the chat itself, it was completely lost in the rest of the UI. You had to scroll to even find the textarea to enter a comment. At first glance the chat area looks like it is only used for showing page transitions and people entering leaving the room.</p>

<p>Bonus points for working with the speakerdeck team on an experimental api. This shows that they&#8217;re willing to go out there and make their ideas happen.</p>

<p>Again, they did a great job focusing on the product and solving a specific problem.&quot;</p>

<h2>Group 6</h2>

<p>This could be sold and deployed as it stands.  Amazing project.</p>

<p>Great job! Clean UI is working really well. This is very solidly put together. I think it would be legit useful for the use case.</p>

<p>The real time analytics were impressive. Other then that the site didn&#8217;t really work&#8230;</p>

<p>amazing!!!!!!</p>

<p>very well done</p>

<p>Wow, this is really excellent.</p>

<p>Agent signup is really confusing.  Fast chatting as a guest is nice, but there was no call to action/I only noticed that I could sign in as an agent once I&#8217;d signed out.  Analytics are beautiful.  Chat itself is kinda spotty, but that&#8217;s probably to be expected with everyone overloading the server.</p>

<p>Definitely still a little buggy. Also, chats did not scroll when others posted.</p>

<p>This is a cool idea, but it seems to require a bit too much explanation up front.  Visually consistent, clean and slick.  Cool idea to be able to embed it.  Confusing about adding people to the room and when that would be applicable.</p>

<p>&quot;When I first entered, I was confused about the flow. I didn&#8217;t understand why I would enter one empty room as a customer. I think that could be explained better.</p>

<p>Once I became an admin user, it was more clear! The lobby and updating rooms is really interesting. There are tons of features!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really nice job.</p>

<p>The only &#8216;iffy&#8217; thing I&#8217;ve seen (and this is nitpicking) is that there&#8217;s not a length limit on the username.</p>

<p>There are a few odd functionality quirks like &#8216;active&#8217; rooms have a list of &#8216;admin&#8217; in them who are not actually online, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a good way to access analytics information over time.&quot;</p>

<p>Very cool widget! That is an awesome feature. Helped really bring the concept together. </p>

<p>Dashboard is cool</p>

<h3>Final Round</h3>

<p>There are some nice features, but the UI is confusing and the concept ends up getting lost as a result.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a very impressive project.  It was a tough call between this and SoapBox for favorite; this is an excellent implementation of a general chat system while SoapBox is an excellent implementation of a more specific tool.</p>

<p>A big differentiator for me was the professional manner in which this project&#8217;s presentation was delivered.  It showed a lot of pride in the work.&quot;</p>

<p>this product is confusing.  it looks nice, but it seems to be even confusing to the team who made it.  seems like you can never get into the same room and it would be hard to join rooms.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice file sharing and inline image and working with that service. Very useful.
thx for google auth. </p>

<p>Some bugs with rooms, text when chatting lags, easy to move between rooms and get lost. Realtime reporting was a nice bonus. &quot;</p>

<p>clean ui. analytics rocks. lobby cool. chat slightly buggy on refresh.</p>

<p>Awesome site!  Great function with great UI.</p>

<p>I liked the features and design a lot but it didn&#8217;t seem like messages were being pulled, so entering an existing room I saw no messages. That was kinda confusing.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice background on the setup.  Clean interface.  Love the UI extras such as multiple images, DnD, lightbox, etc.</p>

<p>Analytics is VERY slick.  This feels like the most complete implementation, but I voted for soapbox because it is more useful to me personally.  Tough call.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;I was Ops&quot;&quot; &#8211; I thought the point of this project was for <em>everyone</em> to get experience building a VPS? </p>

<p>Once I am already logged in, and I enter an additional room, I see &quot;&quot;Joshua changed name to Joshua&quot;&quot; :(</p>

<p>Tests are a bit hit-and-miss :(</p>

<p>&#8216;thin_auth&#8217; has specs &#8216;user&#8217; and &#8216;user api&#8217;, but has a &#8216;test&#8217; folder with lots of empty test files &#8211; looks like you didn&#8217;t configure Rails to auto-generate rspec, but checked in these files anyway. :S</p>

<p>&#8216;thin<em>analytics&#8217; - RoomsController and UsersController, #history and #long</em>history = wtf? looks like this is dummy test data?</p>

<p>Each app should have a Readme file that describes the app, not the generic &quot;&quot;Welcome to Rails&quot;&quot; Readme.</p>

<p>widget button is very cool, design is clean and very usable.</p>

<p>&quot;
Really buggy; surprising, this felt really solid yesterday, not sure what was going on today. Lobby was weird, agents online didn&#8217;t necessarily make sense or line up with what I saw, couldn&#8217;t tell who was where, or what was going on/how to chat with specific people.</p>

<p>Really well-executed UI. The feature-list is really impressive but it seems a little buggy. Might have preferred to see less features that worked really cleanly. It seemed like old messages weren&#8217;t getting pulled and some of my &quot;invites&quot; were going to the wrong people, or to everyone. Also my &quot;lobby&quot; isn&#8217;t pulling rooms - I only see one room at a time.</p>

<p>&quot;- super quick, clean interface that is easy to navigate
- LOVE the photo feature
- The invite link in the sidebar didn&#8217;t give me much feedback (would be nice if the link changed states or something to indicate that something happened)
- this app was addictive to use&quot;</p>

<p>Very nice! I really digged the realtime analytics, and the clean UI.</p>

<p>Splashpage design is great. It should have some micro screenshots. I love the polish of your demo presentation &#8211; handoffs are great. I really like the premise. There are some oddities around the heartbeat system, it seemed like people were appearing and disappearing from the list quickly. </p>

<p>&quot;Best UI out of all the projects. The menu button in the corner is interesting to see since it is a design pattern commonly seen in mobile apps. It reduces a lot of noise on the screen and shows that the team draws from different source to create a solid product.</p>

<ul>
<li>The embedable widget is a unique feature.</li>
<li>Did a good job with uploading and displaying images (drag &amp; drop, image preview, large image preview in a modal, and supported other file types with corresponding icons).</li>
<li>As for analytics it was nice to see that they added real-time monitoring.</li>
<li>The build a solid, simple tool that looks the most polished out of all the projects.</li>
<li>They thought critically about the operations standpoint, which is something that most devs struggle with. Nice to see that they carried this  focus through to the analytics.
&quot;</li>
</ul>
